# blue-tarps
## Final Project for DS 6030
This project was completed during 2nd semester (Fall 2021) at UVA’s MS in Data Science Program to fulfill the DS 6030 “Statistical Learning” course.

The project uses R and develops a classifier for discerning “blue tarps” from "non-blue tarps" in a scenario related to the 2010 Haiti Earthquake in which the classifier is intended to quicken response and recovery for survivors.

Multiple statistical models are developed and evaluated including Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, LDA and QDA
